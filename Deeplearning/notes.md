Steps in modeling with TensorFlow
1. Create a model: define the input and output layers, as well as the hidden layers of a deep learning model.
2. Compile a model: define the loss function (in other words, the function which tells our model how wrong or how to improve the pattern)
3. Fitting a model - let the model try to find patterns between X & y
